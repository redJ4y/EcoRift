# Description
EcoRift is an Android 2D platform game that relies heavily on real time weather data. The player will navigate through multiple levels and battle enemies. Enemies are comprised of Sun, Rain, Storm and Snow. The in-game weather reflects the retrieved weather data at your location. Enemies are buffed and enhanced depending on their type and current weather state. Players can gain stronger attacks depending on their completed progress of the levels.
